# Module 2: Final Evaluation

Hello there! Here you're going to find information about how to access my final evaluation project for module 2 of the web programming bootcamp in Adalab!

This is the final product in case you want to see it before accessing it: http://beta.adalab.es/modulo-2-evaluacion-final-brunadasilvabz/

> This web-page is optimized for the following screen sizes: 320px, 768px and 1024px.

## Everything you need to know about this project

My task was to make a web-page about Breaking Bad with the following functionalities and requirements:

1. Print on the web-page all the character cards using **fetch**.
2. Add a **search bar** so that the user could search for their preferred character.
3. Make a **favorite characters list**, and make sure that the user could add the characters to the list by clicking on their respective cards.
4. Use **localStorage** to save the favorite characters.

As this was a module 2 project, they wanted us to **focus more on JavaScript** and then work on CSS, so that we could first practice some of the following JavaScript characteristics:

- fetch
- functions
- conditionals
- arrays
- objects
- loops

.. as well as getting comfortable using **APIs** and **localStorage**.

## Follow these steps to access my project!

It's important to mention that for this project I'm using Node JS and the Adalab Web Starter Kit that already has gulp implemented so, with that said:

1. You need to make sure you have **Node JS** installed and that you can use **gulp** on your computer, or else you won't be able to run it properly.

2. Either **clone** the repository or **download** it. I recommend downloading it so that it works without any problems!

3. Use the terminal to **install dependencies** using:
   <dl>npm install</dl>

4. **Run the project** with:
   <dl>npm start</dl>

..and you're done!

I hope this project is useful to you!
